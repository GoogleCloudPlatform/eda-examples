# EDA Workloads on Google Cloud

Here are examples of template snippets used to spin up Google Cloud resources
for typical EDA workloads.

Examples include:

- [All on Cloud](example-all-on-cloud.md)
- Burst to Cloud (TBD)
- [Standalone EDA VMs](example-standalone-vm.md)

**Please note that these are provided only as examples to help guide
infrastructure planning and are not intended for use in production. They are
deliberately simplified for clarity and lack significant details required for
production-worthy infrastructure implementation.**
